General information
===================

genbuf is a generic line buffering tool that can be used for about anything
that is linebased and needs buffering.


Supported streams
=================

Input types (one or more):
	* file : File / Pipe / Fifo
	* tcp  : TCP/IP
	* udp  : UDP/IP
	* unix : Unix Domain sockets

Output types (one):
	* file : File / Pipe / Fifo
	* tcp  : TCP/IP
	(TODO udp: UDP/IP)
	(TODO unix: Unix domain sockets)

	
Backlog
=======

Genbuf has backlog support. If delivery fails 3 times, it will write the entire
buffer to file. As soon as delivery succeeds again it will stop writing to the
backlog and write the entire backlog to the recipient, afterwards it truncates
the backlog and resumes with the buffer.
